#summary Gemstones mod page

= Gemstones! =

This mod adds gemstones to the world, which can be mined and crafted into tools and blocks.

It currently includes rubies, emeralds and sapphires, but I'm planning to add more gems in a near future.

The recipes for tools are the same as the normal ones (replacing iron, stone, etc. by gemstones), and a block is made of 9 gems.
